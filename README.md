This repository contains a sample project demonstrating the integration of Fluent Validation and Mediator Pattern in an ASP.NET Core 8 application, leveraging Reactive Extensions (Rx).

Project Overview
This project showcases the implementation of a simple ASP.NET Core 8 application with features including:

Fluent Validation: Fluent Validation is utilized for validating incoming requests.
Mediator Pattern: Mediator Pattern is employed to decouple request handling and promote better maintainability and scalability.

Reactive Extensions (Rx): Reactive Extensions are used to handle asynchronous and event-based programming efficiently.

Installation and Setup
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/stevsharp/Asp.netCoreAndReactive.git
Navigate to Project Directory: Enter the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Asp.netCoreAndReactive
Build and Run: Use the .NET CLI to build and run the project:

arduino
Copy code
dotnet build
dotnet run
Alternatively, you can run the project using Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

#FluentValidation.AspNetCore: A popular .NET library for fluent validation in ASP.NET Core applications.
#MediatR: A simple, unambitious mediator implementation in .NET for handling commands, queries, and events.
#System.Reactive: Reactive Extensions (Rx) library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences.

Usage
Once the project is running, you can interact with the application using HTTP requests.

Send requests to the specified endpoints.
Validation rules defined using Fluent Validation will be applied to incoming requests.
Mediator Pattern will handle the requests and execute the appropriate handlers.
